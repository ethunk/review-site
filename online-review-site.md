### Introduction

In this challenge you'll be building a full-fledged web application from scratch. Users should be able to add new items and write reviews of them. The item for review can be anything you want (e.g. restaurants, food trucks, museums, concert venues, etc.).

You will be expected to write user stories to complete this assignment. Not only will you write a series of user stories, but you will formulate acceptance criteria, write tests that reflect that criteria, and then write code to build out functionality and get the tests to pass.

The purpose of this project is two-fold:

1. Learn how to build an app and use proper TDD and git workflow
2. Figure out a few more complicated features, such as a search bar
3. Touch on several of the key features of basic Rails app

### Setting Expectations

This project ties together many of the core skills and technologies you have learned so far â€” and asks you to push yourself to learn a few more. The scope and nature of this challenge is designed to simulate aspects of the web developer workflow experience. As such, __managing__ workflow, timelines and expectations is equally important - even if you are working on your own.

Most real-world projects are large, evolving, ongoing bodies of work. They are **not** intended to be completed in a single sitting, never to be touched again. In the same way, you should view this as an ongoing project that you spend quite a few working sessions on. During each session, plan to make incremental progress on a feature or two.

Taking your time and pacing your work, this challenge may span a couple weeks - and that's completely normal. Do not rush through the assignment, as this is an opportunity to practice TDD and refine your git workflow, which are both extremely practical skills for a professional software developer.

### Core Requirements

At a minimum, you must supply the following functionality:

* The ability to add, delete, edit and delete an item
* The ability to rate (score on a scale) items and leave an optional review
* The ability to sign in and sign up, using Devise for authentication

You must also:

* Use git workflow to keep your project organized
* Write tests that guide your code and keep your badges' scores high

### Non-Core Requirements

At a minimum you must implement two or three of these optional features:

* Admin users who can delete inappropriate material or users
* The ability of an authenticated user to upvote or downvote a review, similar to [Reddit](http://reddit.com). A user can only upvote or downvote a review once and can change his or her vote from up to down. This feature should utilize AJAX (and an internal Rails API endpoint) so that a complete page reload isn't necessary.
* A search bar that allows a user to sift through items displayed on the index
* The ability to store photographs and/or profile pictures stored in the cloud, using Amazon Web Services and CarrierWave, so they are more reliably available
* The ability to send users automatic emails when certain events, like a new review on their item, occur

Each of these features will be described in more detail below or in previous Phase 11 assignments, but many will require you to do some independent research - read gem documentation, watch RailsCasts, etc. Embrace the challenge! You'll need those research skills as a developer long after Launch Academy.

### Getting Started Checklist

* Decide what kind of review site you'll be building
* Create an ER diagram for the tables you plan to build
* Write user stories for your first two features, just to get Started
* Organize your approach, using [Trello](https://trello.com/) or [Pivotal Tracker](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/dashboard)
* Create your new rails app (directions below)
* Create a repository on Github, add your mentor to it, and push your starting
code ("initial commit") to the remote repo
* Ask other students or your mentor if you have questions about your review site

### Create a New Rails Application

Create a new rails app with postgres and rspec with the following steps:
- Create a empty directory with your app name
- Run this in the root of that directory: `rails new . --database=postgresql --skip-turbolinks --skip-test-unit -T` && `bundle`
- `rake db:create`
- Be sure you have the following gems in the Gemfile:

**Note:** The `rails new` generated Gemfile has many commented lines/gems. You can
always get these back by `rails new'ing` a new project and looking at that
project's Gemfile so it's much cleaner to delete all these commented lines of code
after you've created your Gemfile.  

```ruby
gem 'foundation-rails'

group :development, :test do
  gem 'pry-rails'
  gem 'rspec-rails'
  gem 'capybara'
  gem 'launchy'
  gem 'factory_bot'
  gem 'valid_attribute'
  gem 'shoulda-matchers', require: false
end
```

- `bundle` the new added gems and install rspec `rails generate rspec:install`

### User Authentication

Very often, the first place we'll start when writing an app is the `User` model.
Most of our apps will require users to create accounts and login to access many
of the key features.

In Rails, we can use a gem called
[Devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise) to create our `User` model for
us. Devise takes care of user authentication, security, forgotten passwords, etc.  It is widely used and well-tested, so we shouldn't need to worry
about the security of our users' data.

Get started by following the Devise guides:
[here](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise#getting-started).

#### Authentication User Stories

Your implementation should fulfill the following user stories. Add the necessary
acceptance tests to be sure functionality is always working properly:

```no-highlight
As a prospective user
I want to create an account
So that I can post items and review them
```

```no-highlight
As an unauthenticated user
I want to sign in
So that I can post items and review them
```

```no-highlight
As an authenticated user
I want to sign out
So that no one else can post items or reviews on my behalf
```

```no-highlight
As an authenticated user
I want to update my information
So that I can keep my profile up to date
```

```no-highlight
As an authenticated user
I want to delete my account
So that my information is no longer retained by the app
```

### CRUD Behavior

Now that we have users, it's time to add the item we want to review. We'll want
to write user stories for each CRUD action.

CRUD is an acronym representing the major database operations we might want to
perform for a particular model.  It stands for:

* **Create:** Add a record to the database.
* **Read:** Retrieve information about items from the database.
* **Update:** Edit an item's information
* **Delete:** Delete an item from the database.

#### CRUD User Stories

In a standard CRUD app, each of these CRUD operations will correspond to one
(or, for "read", two) user stories:

* Create

```no-highlight
As an authenticated user
I want to add an item
So that others can review it
```

* Read

```no-highlight
As an authenticated user
I want to view a list of items
So that I can pick items to review
```

```no-highlight
As an authenticated user
I want to view the details about an item
So that I can get more information about it
```

* Update

```no-highlight
As an authenticated user
I want to update an item's information
So that I can correct errors or provide new information
```

* Delete

```no-highlight
As an authenticated user
I want to delete an item
So that no one can review it
```

**Note:** You may decide that you want certain features, such as an index, to be available to unauthenticated users, or non-users who visit the site. In that case, you can modify the first line of the relevant user story to reflect that.

#### CRUD Implementation

Complete the CRUD user stories for the item you want to review.

#### Modify the User Stories

Tailor the user stories above to suit your app and add acceptance criteria to
further guide your implementation.

Acceptance criteria should specify the following, at a minimum:

* What conditions must be met for the task to be completed.
  * Ex. "I must be logged in to add an item."
* Which fields are required.
  * Ex. "I must provide an item name and description."
* Which fields are optional.
  * Ex. "I may optionally provide the item's website."
* What happens in the case of an error.
  * Ex. "If I do not supply the required information, I receive an error message."
  * Ex. "If an item with that name is already in the database, I receive an error message."

#### Create a New Feature Branch

Create a new branch prefixed with your initials, for example:

```no-highlight
$ git branch hh-fs-add-<item_name>-model
```

#### Write an Acceptance Test

Before you begin your implementation for each user story, write an acceptance
test for it.

#### Create a Pull Request

Push up your branch to GitHub and create a pull request. Consult your mentor or
other students if you need guidance on how to create a pull request.

### Continuous Delivery

While developing your review site, you should practice [continuous
delivery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_delivery). This means, that
after a feature is complete and the test suite passes, the app should be
deployed to production for the world to see.

The master branch of your project should be treated as a sacred place: A place
where only finished and tested code shall live. If you adheres to this mantra,
and code branches are not prematurely merged into master, the master branch can
be deployed to production at any time, with little worry of failure.

We will use Heroku as our production environment to serve our application to
users. See the [Getting Started with Rails
4](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-rails4)
documentation on Heroku for instructions on getting your Rails app live on the
Internets.

### Reviewing Items

Using the examples in the last assignment, write user stories and acceptance
criteria for reviews.

Your user stories should cover:

* A user adding a review
* A user viewing a list of reviews for an item
* A user updating a review
* A user deleting a review

Before writing any code for this feature, create a new branch of your
repository. Then write an acceptance test for the review functionality before
implementing it.

Once the feature is complete, carefully review your code, then open a pull request on GitHub to merge back into master.

### Optional Administrators

Many Web apps have separate admins who can perform tasks that regular users cannot. Let's give admins the ability to delete inappropriate items or reviews or obnoxious users' accounts.

Write user stories and acceptance criteria to cover the following situations:

* An admin views a list of users
* An admin deletes a user
* An admin deletes an item
* An admin deletes a review

Follow the git and TDD workflow you've established when completing prior features.

#### Hints

There are two general approaches to implementing admin functionality: Add
conditional statements to existing views and controllers to check for admins or define a separate set of views/controllers only accessible to admins.

Adding conditional checks for admins to existing views may look something like:

```html
<% @items.each do |item| %>
  <!-- some stuff here -->

  <% if current_user.admin? %>
    <%= button_to 'Delete', item, method: :delete %>
  <% end %>
<% end %>
```

Merely hiding a button or creating a separate view does not prevent malicious
users from performing admin-only actions, such as triggering our
`ItemsController#destroy` action. Malicious users could still delete records by
sending hand-crafted HTTP requests to delete the record directly. Ensure that
you have the appropriate checks in your controller to ensure that the
authenticated user has the appropriate permissions to perform certain actions.

An alternative is to using **namespacing** to define a set of routes and
controllers that are only accessible to admin users:

```ruby
namespace :admin do
  resources :items
end
```

With separate controllers and views you can simplify the authorization checks by
allowing only admins to view certain portions of the app.


### Optional Voting

Now that we've got items and reviews, you have the option of letting users vote on reviews.

Write user stories and acceptance criteria to cover the following situations:

* A user votes on a review
* A user changes their vote
* A user deletes their vote

Make sure a user can only vote once per review.

This feature should be implemented using AJAX so that a complete page reload is not required. Your AJAX call should communicate with an internal Rails API endpoint that you create.

**DO NOT USE** the `act_as_votable` gem to implement this feature. As before,
start by checking out a new feature branch.  Write a controller test, make the
test pass, and repeat until your user stories are complete.  Create a Pull
Request containing your completed code.

### Search Bar

Add a search bar that allows users to search for items. First, write a user story and acceptance criteria for this feature. Then take some time to try to figure out how to do this on your own.

If you're stuck, consult past Sinatra apps that had search functionality, or
[this Railscast](http://railscasts.com/episodes/37-simple-search-form) or [this
blog article](http://www.stefanosioannou.com/rails-4-simple-search-form/).
